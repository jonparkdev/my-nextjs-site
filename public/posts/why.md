Finally...it has been over a year since I have wanted to write this blog. I am sitting here on this Saturday afternoon with this weight lifted off my shoulders, putting the metaphorical pen to paper. But I digress as this weight known to me as perfectionism is a topic for another time.

What I wanted to address is the motivations behind starting this blog. The theme will hopefully be more academic. I want to use it as a medium to experiment and challenge myself with new and difficult ideas. Ideas that could span anywhere from the somewhat absolute nature of mathematics to contentious topics in law in politics.

At the same time there might be some post of this nature. That is of self-reflection. Just to stay in the habit, as I know if I don't, the next post will probably start the same way this one did.

Most importantly, this blog is for me to work on my knowledge and communication. As someone once told me, if you have a thought but you can't express it, then you don't really have that thought.
