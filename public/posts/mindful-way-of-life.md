I try to live an undistracted way of life.  What does this involve? I don't have any social media other than email on my phone. I turn off all my notification so that my attention isn't constantly being taken away from whatever I am doing at that time.  When I am doing work, my phone is somewhere out of reach and when I sleep, my phone is in another room.  Some of the reasons to why I do this are apparent but I will elaborate to best explain how I feel.  First, why am I writing this?

Recently, I got into a small dispute about availability.   The details are not necessary but one small comment still resonates,

** "Don't you have your messenger notifications on." **  

This seemingly innocent comment bothered me because it was coming from a point view that didn't understand my choice in how I decide to go about my life.  It implicitly preached a norm that is ... well... for lack of already using the most appropriate word... a **_norm_** in our modern day.  That is,  since the advances in social media we are so connected, it is expected that you are always available.  Whether that is Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, iMessage, Google Hangout, KiK, WeChat, Telegram.... and I am sure you get the point.

It wasn't always like this.  Not too long ago, people had to schedule things by means other then a text or messenger application.  To make things more complicated, when you showed up to an engagement, you had to wait.  There was no, "where are you?" text to satisfy that itch.  That itch that you feel when you are bored and there is no stimulus around you.   That itch where your expecting some sort of validation from a message you sent, a picture you posted, or just waiting for something to happen in your world of social media.  I know this feeling all to well, sitting uncomfortably alone, pulling out my phone to see who had contacted me, feeling that satisfaction of hearing the sound of a notification go off, that phantom vibration in your pocket when no one was there, scrolling continuously through that infinite feed.  This thing that I am referring to - that I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with to a certain degree - I argue pervasively reinforces this norm of immediate gratification, immediate connection, immediate validation and immediate availability that never existed before.  Its okay to occupy yourself to certain degree with social media and in some circumstances it's productive to be that connected and social.  I would also like to note though I have a cynical view, social technologies are an extremely powerful tool with many very positive benefits. But that is the catch, social media is a double edged sword. Reflecting my own values, social media technology is more a negative than positive and obviously this will vary from person to person.  So to mitigate what I think are negative effects of this Pavlovian conditioning, I chose to set rules for myself.  Including the ones I already described above:

- I don't touch any technology first thing in the morning
- I only check my notifications after my morning routine is done and a little later in the afternoon
- My phone goes away after 8pm and sometimes right after work if my mind is cluttered
- I try my best to avoid screens late at night to practice sleep hygiene

These are small little changes that have had profound impacts.  I am more focused and more disciplined then ever before as I have less distractions pulling me off the path that I want to travel.  I am less stressed out and I have turned sitting with that discomfort that we all get from time to time into productivity.   

The argument and criticism I mainly get is in the form of a question; If that's the case, how do I get in touch with you?  Let me reassure you I am no a hermit and I am not ignoring communication I get.  I may not respond immediately, but as most business emails put it, "expect a response within 24 hours".  Most likely even sooner.  

It may seem like I am trying to escape technological society but I am not.  I use technology to make my life better according to the desiderata I have set out for myself.  I still use good'ol fashion email as it's an important part of my work, as I am sure I am not the only one.  In terms of social media, I have Facebook which I rarely use and somehow have rationalised that its important because I can use it to keep in touch with people... but that argument becomes weaker as time goes on.  I have messenger (Facebook Messenger)  which is a reminiscence of a past business/club I use to run (Muay Thai for those who know me).  I try to check that once every couple days because I do stay in touch with people.  I would like to note that this is all done on my desktop computer so I do not get notifications on my phone.

This post is somewhat all over the place so I'll stop there and sum up what I am trying to say.   In terms of the dispute I mentioned earlier, I don't mean to sound flippant but I am irritated that I was expected to be available immediately at a moments notice because of this norm.  In a world that becomes more and more distracted, I believe it's a virtue to set boundaries that prioritise focus and mindfulness as the rewards first, propagate much further then just yourself and second, outweigh the benefits that come from use of social technologies.  Don't let someone tell you otherwise.
